- 👋 Hi, I’m Shane, an Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering Student at RPI.
- 👀 I’m interested in nuclear reactors, vehicle design, command and control systems, as well as defense system design. I also like to work with video game development such as mods.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, C, Python, and Assembly.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything involving my interests, but I am willing to try things outside of that.
- 📫 Contact me at shanesklyar123@gmail.com , I will get back to you as soon as I can.
